# vanilla-weather-app
A weather app created with vanilla JS. The app fetches information as well as icons from the SheCodes Weather API, pictures used have been generated by an open AI.

The code is a JavaScript program that fetches weather data using the SheCodes API, displays the current weather for a given location, allows the user to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit, and displays a five-day weather forecast.

The program begins by declaring variables for the API key, the current temperature in Celsius, and the current feels-like temperature in Celsius. It then defines event listeners for the search form and search button, and a function to handle a search for a new city. The search function takes the value of the search field, constructs a URL to the SheCodes API, and sends a GET request using the Axios library. If the request is successful, a function is called to replace the app values (i.e., update the UI with the new weather data), and a second function is called to prepare the forecast. If the request fails, an error message is displayed.

The program also defines event listeners for the current location button, the Celsius button, and the Fahrenheit button. The current location button calls the Geolocation API to retrieve the user's current location and sends a request to the SheCodes API using the user's latitude and longitude. The Celsius and Fahrenheit buttons convert the current temperature and feels-like temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit and update the UI accordingly.

Finally, the program defines two functions for displaying the forecast. The prepareForecast function constructs a URL to the SheCodes API for the five-day forecast and sends a GET request using Axios. If the request is successful, a function is called to display the forecast. The displayForecast function formats and displays the forecast data.
